# Dataset Description

The dataset consists of lung X-ray images from children, carefully pre-cleaned, and labeled by medical specialists.
It includes a total of 5,856 high-resolution image files with a combined size of 1.15GB.
The images are labeled based on the presence or absence of pneumonia, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

# Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
The dataset has undergone thorough preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
Pre-cleaning and labeling by medical specialists contribute to the reliability and accuracy of the data.

# Use
The dataset is for use in developing machine learning image classification algorithms.
